Your team is bidding to build some internal software for a trendy new restaurant. In order to get the bid, your team must quickly build a prototype that demonstrates how the orders will look on the restaurant's internal webpage.

Each member of the staff has their own unique style and wants that to be reflected in the orders that they take. As a team, you decide to create a dashboard that shows the tables & orders for each waitstaff. Strangely, the restaurant's waitstaff has the same number of people as your team, so you decide that each developer will research and build the JavaScript for a wait staffer and add a section to the index.html file to display that staff's tables and orders.

1. Plan your application
- Decide on a theme and plan for the application
- Complete a wireframe of the application
- Create a project board with defined tasks
- One member should create the repository and give permission to the rest of the group. Create a single index.html
1. Each member of the group should create their own JavaScript file for the waite staff member they are representing.
2. Each member of the group should add a section to the index.html file to display a list of that staffers’ tables and orders.
    
    Note: expect merge conflicts when you are all working on the index.html and make a plan on how you will resolve them.
    

## Challenges:

Finish your MVP before starting any challenges.

1. Add the concept of orders being complete vs in progress. Keep in mind that the same table can be assigned to two different guests, but only one guest can be the current
2. Add a tip value to each complete order.
- Display the tips on the DOM.
- Display the total of tips on the DOM
